**openSRF**
==================================
PHP client for [openSRF](http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.9/_introducing_opensrf.html), a [message passing architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing#Message_passing_systems) used by the [Evergreen Integrated Library System (ILS)](http://evergreen-ils.org).


***A quick intro to openSRF***
While this client aims to hide technical details, developers are encouraged to be familiar with the internals of OpenSRF before working with it:

* The ["Easing gently into the OpenSRF"](http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.9/_easing_gently_into_opensrf.html) chapter of the Evergreen documentation
* There is also an [http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/3284](article by Dan Scott) ; partially superseded by the above but still of interest.

Documentation
-------

The working of this library is explained in the [doc README](docs/README.md).
